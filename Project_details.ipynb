By applying exploratory data analysis and training a Random Forest model, I was able to identify significant relationships between climate variables,such as temperature and precipitation—and ecological traits of mammal species. These relationships provide early indicators of how environmental disruptions may influence species vulnerability and distribution.\n",

Random Forest, for example, highlighted the predictive strength of climate-based features in assessing ecosystem risk, demonstrating the potential of AI to support conservation science and environmental monitoring.\n",
